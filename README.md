# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description


This project was created to practice & display the topics I learned about in boot camp Prework. It was built to store my notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript in one spot. Through this project, I learned more about navigating GitHub & VS Code and how they can be used to build web applications.

## Usage


The Prework Study Guide can be used to learn about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Notes for each of these topics are displayed in their respective sections. Users can open the Chrome DevTools Console panel to view the topics covered in Prework and receive a suggestion on which subject to study first. The Console panel can be accessed by pressing Command+Option+I in MacOS, or Control+Shift+I in Windows and will display both the list of taught topics and a learning suggestion once opened.
